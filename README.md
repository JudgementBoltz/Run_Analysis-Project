# Run_Analysis-Project
This program runs an analysis on a set of data provided then returns a tidy data set. It takes all of the raw data and merges it to one dataframe. Using only the observations for features with mean() and std(), the mean of each feature;s observations for each subject performing a specific activity is taken. Finally a tidy data set is returned in 4 columns labeled in this order:
<br>
<table><tr><td>Subject</td><td>Activity</td><td>Feature</td><td>Mean</td></tr></table>

For information on features refer to "CodeBook.txt"

Place this script in the UCI HAR Dataset sub-directory of the unzipped directory getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset provided in the assignment.

The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.  This script will access both the Test and Train subdirectories to load in raw data to R dataframes.

x_test, y_test, and subject_test files are read into dataframes then merged so that each observation from x_test will correlate to the subject # from subject_train, and an activity label from y_test.

x_train, y_train, and subject_train files are read into dataframes then merged so that each observation from x_train will correlate to the subject # from subject_train, and an activity label from y_train.

Each of these dataframes are then merged into one large dataframe for analysis.
An empty dataframe called tidy_data is initialized to store tidy data from analysis, and activity label columns are created for labeling purposes in later steps.

Next, a for loop cycles through all subject labels(for subjects 1-30). For each subject and each activity, the mean value of all features that are measurements of mean or standard deviation is returned then added into the the tidy_data dataframe.

Lastly descriptive column names are added to the tidy_data dataframe, and the data is written to the file "tidy_data.txt"
